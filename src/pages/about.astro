      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At CipherFlow, our mission is to demystify the complex world of encryption and data security. We believe that understanding how cryptography works is a fundamental aspect of digital literacy in the 21st century. Through interactive visualizers, clear guides, and in-depth articles, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for students, developers, and the security-curious.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        CipherFlow was started by Pashalis Laoutaris, a passionate Developer with a deep interest in cybersecurity. Frustrated by the lack of approachable and hands-on learning tools, we set out to build the platform we wished we had when we were first starting.
        For more info about Pashalis, you can check out his <a href="https://laoutaris.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.

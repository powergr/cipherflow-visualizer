      <h2>How to Use the Visualizers</h2>
      <p>
        Our interactive visualizers are the core of CipherFlow. They are designed to be intuitive, but here is a breakdown of the common controls you will find:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enter Text:</strong> This is the input field for your plaintext message that you wish to encrypt.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Key Input:</strong> For algorithms that require a key (like Caesar, Vigen√®re, etc.), this is where you will enter it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Generate/Encrypt Button:</strong> Click this to start the step-by-step visualization process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed Control:</strong> Use the slider to adjust the speed of the animation, allowing you to follow along at your own pace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step-by-Step Breakdown:</strong> As the visualization runs, a panel will typically show a log or explanation of each transformation, substitution, or permutation as it happens.
        </li>
      </ul>
